# Simple-Color-FlipperJS
The Color Flipper is a simple yet interactive web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to dynamically change the background color of the webpage with a single button click.  

Features:
✅ Two Modes:

Simple Mode: Changes the background to predefined colors (e.g., red, green, blue).
Hex Mode: Generates a random hex color code for a more diverse range of colors.
✅ Dynamic UI Updates:

The displayed color code updates in real time as the background color changes.
✅ Minimalist Design:

A clean and responsive layout with a simple navigation bar.

📌 How It Works

Click the "Touch Me" button to change the background color.

The color code updates dynamically to reflect the new background color.

Switch between Simple Mode and Hex Mode using the navigation links.
